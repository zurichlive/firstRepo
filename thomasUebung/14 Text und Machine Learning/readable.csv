7,17,168,31.54,"Race war started by Texas teacher  A Texas fourth-grade teacher Karen Fitzgibbons published a racial Facebook post in which she confirmed that Black people are responsible for racial tensions in the USA. Moreover she claimed that she is ""almost to the point"" of defending the segregation. After her post about the recent pool party incident drew local attention, the teacher deleted her profile.  ""This makes me ANGRY! This officer should not have had to resign. I\'m going to just go ahead and say it....the blacks are the ones causing the problems and this `racial tension. I  guess that\'s what happens when you flunk out of school and have no education. I\'m sure their parents are just as guilty for not knowing what their kids were doing; or knew it and didn\'t care,"" she wrote. She also added,""I\'m almost to the point of wanting them all segregated on one side of town so they can hurt each other and leave the innocent people alone. Maybe the 50s and 60s were really on to something. Now, let the bashing of my true and honest opinion begin .... GO! #imnotracist #imsickofthemcausingtrouble #itwasagatedcommunity"".  As we see Karen Fitzgibbons is a real racist, who approves the humiliation of black people! This news clearly reflects that American society is close to collapse, if not to say to war. As the authorities are doing nothing to resolve the situation, in the near future we may face real race war within our country.",Age: 18 - 65+,06/11/15 07:03:58 AM PDT,N/A,N/A,"Location: United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri;\n\nCleveland Ohio\n",P(1)0002114.pdf,Placements: News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile
